    "## What you will learn in this course? 🧐🧐\n",
    "\n",
    "As an analyst, one of your mission is to enlighten managers in their decision making process. One way to do so is by building dashboards. There are plently of tools out there like Tableau, PowerBI to build them but you can actually do it with Python and a great library called `streamlit`. One of the main advantages is that `streamlit` is a web dashboard, therefore, anybody can check it right from the internet! In this course, you will learn:\n",

    "## Get started 🏎️ 💨\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to get you started with `streamlit` is to actually check out a real application. Let's check this app we just made for you: \n",
    "\n",
    "* [Streamlit sample app](https://jedha-streamlit-demo.herokuapp.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see basic functionalities on this app that will be useful for you when you'll want to build your own. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you want to check the source code, here is the link:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Streamlit sample app source code](https://github.com/JedhaBootcamp/streamlit-demo-app)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to be able to run it, you will need to clone this Github repository somewhere on your computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 Reminder: `git clone REPO_URL` \n",
    "\n",
    "Then run (for iOS, linux, and windows powershell): \n",
    "\n",
    "`docker run -it -v \"$(pwd):/home/app\" -e PORT=80 -p 4000:80 jedha/streamlit-sample-app` \n",
    "\n",
    "for windows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`docker run -it -v \"%cd%:/home/app\" -e PORT=80 -p 4000:80 jedha/streamlit-sample-app` \n",
    "\n",
    "You should now be able to run your application locally by opening your browser and going to: `http://0.0.0.0:4000`\n",

    "\n",
    "### Optimizing performance\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that is important when you are building web application is **performance**. Your app cannot need more than 30 seconds to load. But if you have a really heavy dataset that you need to load, how do you do it? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well there are two things that you can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cache data (meaning load it once and then store locally on the user's browser)\n",
    "2. Use UX/UI components to make users more patient \n",
    "\n",
    "**Caching data with `st.cache_data`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by the most important one: [`st.cache_data`](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching). Whenever you are building a function that requires a lot of computing power (e.g loading large datasets), simply add `@st.cache_data` before your function, just like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import streamlit as st \n",
    "\n",
    "@st.cache_data\n",
    "def load_data:\n",
    "  df = pd.read_csv(\"MY_HEAVY_DATASET.csv\")\n",
    "  return df \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn more, feel free to check out [streamlit's examples of caching](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#example-1-basic-usage). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Using UX/UI components** \n",
    "\n",
    "Now sometimes UX (User eXperience) is sufficient for your user to wait. For example, simply having a spinner displaying that some data is currently loading is a signal that user are used to. Try to use them in your app whenever you have a computation-heavy operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In streamlit's documentation, it is called [*Status Elements*](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/status). Try them out in your app. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you might want to customize your app and get away from Streamlit's pre-built configurations. There are especially two things you might want: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Customize your app's appearance \n",
    "2. Customize your server's configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "For both these needs, you will need to: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a `.streamlit` folder within your working directory\n",
    "2. Create a `config.toml` file where your configuration specifications will live. \n",
    "\n",
    "> 👋 For advanced students: Since we are using Docker containers, your `.streamlit` needs to be within your current working directory (where your code is). If you were not using Docker, `.streamlit` folder would need to be at the root directory of your computer (e.g `~/.streamlit/`). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Customize your app's appearance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to customize your app appearance, simply go into your `config.toml` file and setup the following properties: \n",
    "\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "# Within your config.toml file\n",
    "[theme]\n",
    "primaryColor=\"#HEXADECIMAL_COLOR\"\n",
    "backgroundColor=\"#HEXADECIMAL_COLOR\"\n",
    "secondaryBackgroundColor=\"#HEXADECIMAL_COLOR\"\n",
    "textColor=\"#HEXADECIMAL_COLOR\"\n",
    "font=\"sans serif\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> 👋 `font` is not really customizable. at this time, you have a choice between three options (`['sans serif', 'serif', 'monospace']`)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Customize your server config**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a more advanced topic that you might need later on when you'll be deploying your applications on remote servers (using Docker, Heroku etc.). In your `config.toml` you can setup some of your server's configuration like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "[browser]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Internet address where users should point their browsers in order to connect to the app. Can be IP address or DNS name and path.\n",
    "# This is used to: - Set the correct URL for CORS and XSRF protection purposes. - Show the URL on the terminal - Open the browser - Tell the browser where to connect to the server when in liveSave mode.\n",
    "# Default: 'localhost'\n",
    "serverAddress = \"localhost\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Whether to send usage statistics to Streamlit.\n",
    "# Default: true\n",
    "gatherUsageStats = true\n",
    "\n",
    "# Port where users should point their browsers in order to connect to the app.\n",
    "# This is used to: - Set the correct URL for CORS and XSRF protection purposes. - Show the URL on the terminal - Open the browser - Tell the browser where to connect to the server when in liveSave mode.\n",
    "# Default: whatever value is set in server.port.\n",
    "serverPort = 8501\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> 👋 Most likely, you will need to customize: \n",
    ">\n",
    ">* `serverPort`\n",
    ">* `serverAddress`\n",
    ">\n",
    "> For example, in our application that you ran locally we setup a `serverPort=80` and a `serverAddress=0.0.0.0`. But if that's fuzzy for you right now, don't sweat it. You will go back to this section of the course once you actually need it. \n"
