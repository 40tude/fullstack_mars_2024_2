    "Now that you have learned a lot about Data Science stricto sensu, it is time for you to get some development experience. As you will grow as a Data Scientist, Data Analyst or Data Engineer, you won't only be building Machine Learning algorithms but develop complete data applications which you will put into production, meaning that you'll make them available for users. The first step in sending any product into production is defining the appropriate environment (just like the first step in growing a new plant is making sure you setup an appropriate environment for it to thrive). It is therefore important that you get familiar with your local environment to be able to understand more complex infrastructures. In this course, we will cover: \n",
