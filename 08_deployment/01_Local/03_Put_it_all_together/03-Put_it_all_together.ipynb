    "Before diving into ANY code, you need to understand one thing: **computers are organized in folders**. We often call these folders: *directories*. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you are writing a program, you need to make sure that each file related to this program is living within the same directory. (This means that any app is just a folder with different files and sub folders in it meant to work together!)\n",
    "\n",
    ">For example, let's say I am building an API, all my files will live in a directory that I call *fast_api_intro*,  just like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> (base) ➜  fast_api_intro tree\n",
    ">   .\n",
    ">   ├── main.py\n",
    ">   └── setup.py\n",
    ">\n",
    ">  0 directories, 2 files\n",
    ">    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "> As you can see, I wrote two files `main.py` and `setup.py` that are the two files related to my new API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as a best practice, you always need to make sure you know where you directories are within your computers. Usually each OS (Windows, Mac, Linux) have predefined folders like *Documents* where you can host your directories. However, that's completely up to you where you put your code.  "
