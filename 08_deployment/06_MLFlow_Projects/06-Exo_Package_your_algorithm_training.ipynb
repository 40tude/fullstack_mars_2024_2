    "Let's learn how to package our algorithm training so that anybody can use it! Here, you will take the code that you worked on in the *Build a cancellation detector algorithm* exercise.\n",

    "* Take back the code you made in the *Cancellation detector algorithm*\n",

    "1. Package your code within an `MLProject` \n",
    "2. Push your project onto Github once its done\n",
    "3. Test whether your packaged training works on remote machine\n",
    "    * You can do so by simply giving your repo URL to a teammate and see if it works on his/her machine. \n",
    "    * Fix bugs if there are some \n",
    "    * You can also try to run it on a remote EC2 machine (Caution though, there are going to be costs if you take a very powerful machine. Expects from $1 to $10. And **make sure to delete your instance after you're done with it**)"
