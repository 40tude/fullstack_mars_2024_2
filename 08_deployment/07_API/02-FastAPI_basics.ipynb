    "## Quickstart \n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic structure of your api file \n",
    "\n",
    "When you are building an api with FastAPI, your `.py` file will have a specific structure that looks like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "import uvicorn\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI\n",
    "\n",
    "### \n",
    "# Here you can define some configurations \n",
    "###\n",
    "\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",
    "\n",
    "###\n",
    "# Here you define enpoints \n",
    "###\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__==\"__main__\":\n",
    "    uvicorn.run(app, host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=4000) # Here you define your web server to run the `app` variable (which contains FastAPI instance), with a specific host IP (0.0.0.0) and port (4000)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should start all your api files like this. Later in this course, we will populate each part of it. But first, let's explain the few lines of code we wrote: \n",
    "\n",
    "* `app = FastAPI()` - Here we create an instance of `FastAPI` that will contain all the functionalities of our application. \n",
    "* `if __name__==\"__main__\":` - This code indicates that we want the below code bloc to run **only if** we are running this file as the main file and not as an import (like you would if you were writting `import filename` as a module).\n",
    "    > More on Modules here 👉 https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html\n",
    "* `uvicorn.run(app, host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=4000)`- Here we tell `uvicorn` to run a web server with all the functionalities contained with `app` variable. We specify some configurations like `host` and `port` that we will need later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Create Endpoints \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to quickly start a simple API, the first thing you need to know is how to build **endpoints**. Endpoints are simply a specific URL an API user will use to get a specific information from the API. For example, an api with the specific: `/fetch-users` path will query users on a specific database. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our demo, we built the *simplest endpoint* at `/` (default endpoint): That will display a greeting message. Just like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "@app.get(\"/\")\n",
    "async def index():\n",
    "\n",
    "    message = \"Hello world! This `/` is the most simple and default endpoint. If you want to learn more, check out documentation of the api at `/docs`\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    return message\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventhough this code doesn't do a whole lot, there is already a lot of information to understand. Let's explain it: \n",
    "\n",
    "* `@app.get(\"/\")` is what we call a decorator that will run the function underneath when a **GET** request at url `/` is received by the API server. \n",
    "    > More on decorators [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-decorators-in-python-by-example-b398328163b)\n",
    "\n",
    "* `async def index():` here we are defining an asynchronous function that is called `index`. The fact that the function is asynchronous is extremely useful because it allows your webserver to load other resources while waiting for this one to load. (An asynchronous function will not block the rest of your code from running if it has not finished yet)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The rest are simple instructions that return a string 😉\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run the app \n",
    "\n",
    "Now your file should look like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "import uvicorn\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI\n",
    "\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.get(\"/\")\n",
    "async def index():\n",
    "\n",
    "    message = \"Hello world! This `/` is the most simple and default endpoint. If you want to learn more, check out documentation of the api at `/docs`\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    return message\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__==\"__main__\":\n",
    "    uvicorn.run(app, host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=4000) # Here you define your web server to run the `app` variable (which contains FastAPI instance), with a specific host IP (0.0.0.0) and port (4000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a docker image using the dockerfile provided in the src section under `api1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to run this app, you can use docker! Simply run (if you are on windows use the powershell):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "docker run -it \\\n",
    "-v \"$(pwd):/home/app\" \\\n",
    "-p 4000:4000 \\\n",
    "-e PORT=4000 \\\n",
    "name_of_your_image\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "PS: Make sure to run the following shell command where your app script is located!\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see the following output: \n",
    "\n",

    "## Build your own `GET` & `POST` requests \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start to build more complex apis. To do so, you will need to learn how to build HTTP requests. The two main ones are `GET` and `POST` requests. Let's see how you can write them. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **`GET`** Requests \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simplest request\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a `GET` request, you need to start by a decorator: \n",
    "\n",
    "* `@app.get(\"ENDPOINT_URL\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "This decorator will tell your application that you want your endpoint to be accessed via **`GET`** request. Now below, you need to have function that be executed once a user call your `ENDPOINT_URL`: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "@app.get(\"/hello\")\n",
    "async def hi():\n",
    "    return 'Hello there 🤗'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Query Parameters \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we don't usually build only a function saying `Hello there 🤗`. We usually need to build more complex endpoints. To do so, we use *Query Parameters*: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "@app.get(\"/custom-greetings\")\n",
    "async def custom_greetings(name: str = \"Mr (or Miss) Nobody\"):\n",
    "    greetings = {\n",
    "        \"Message\": f\"Hello {name} How are you today?\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return greetings\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this new app, use the `api2` folder provided in the sources, build the container then run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "docker run -it \\\n",
    "-v \"$(pwd):/home/app\" \\\n",
    "-p 4000:4000 \\\n",
    "-e PORT=4000 \\\n",
    "name_of_your_image\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we gave a parameter within our `custom_greetings` function. This paramater is simply stating that we want a `str` as parameter and by default (if no parameters is specified by the user), then `name=\"Mr (or Miss) Nobody\"`. This is what we call a *Query Parameter*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use the following query to get custom greetings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "r = requests.get(\"http://localhost:4000/custom-greetings\", params={\"name\":\"Charles\"})\n",
    "r.content\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> 👋 As you can see we returned a `dict`. This is a common good practice to return dictonnaries since APIs usually work with [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)-like data structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Path Parameters \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to specify parameters for a given endpoint is to use *Path paremeters*. This is especially useful when you are trying to retrieve a specific item within a collection of items. Let's take an example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "@app.get(\"/blog-articles/{blog_id}\")\n",
    "async def read_blog_article(blog_id: int):\n",

    "    if blog_id > len(articles):\n",
    "        response = {\n",
    "            \"msg\": \"We don't have that many articles!\"\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        article = articles.iloc[blog_id, :]\n",
    "        response = {\n",

    "            \"author\": article.author\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "    return response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, we created a **`GET`** endpoint that retrieves blog articles. Here the user can retrieve a specific article by providing a specific `blog_id`. \n",
    "\n",
    "> 👋 Here we did not specify a default value for our `blog_id` parameter within `read_blog_article` function. This is because we do want the user to provide a specific number.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create this app use the `api3` folder provided in the sources, there should be a Dockerfile there for you to build the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this you need to use :\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker run -it \\\n",
    "-v \"$(pwd):/home/app\" \\\n",

    "\n",

    "### **`POST`** Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple example \n",
    "\n",
    "With **`POST`** requests, your user can send sensitive data to your server. This is especially useful when it contains `form` data (like emails, names etc.). Contrary to a **`GET`** request, **`POST`** request is not sent through a url which makes it more secure when you want to exchange data with your server. Let's see a simple example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "@app.post(\"/create-blog-article\")\n",
    "async def create_blog_article(blog_article: BlogArticles):\n",
    "    df = pd.read_csv(\"https://full-stack-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/Deployment/articles.csv\")\n",
    "    new_article = pd.Series({\n",
    "        'id': len(df)+1,\n",
    "        'title': blog_article.title,\n",
    "        'content': blog_article.content,\n",

    "    })\n",

    "    df = df.append(new_article, ignore_index=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "    return df.to_json()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the above code creates a new blog article. As you can see the main differences are: \n",
    "\n",
    "* `@app.post(\"ENDPOINT_URL\")` - instead of a `.get()` request, we use the `.post()` method in our decorator. \n",
    "* `BlogArticles` - We haven't talked about it yet. This is a class that specifies the data that we will receive that you can access with `blog_article.XXXX` \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore something is missing within the code. Let's talk about it now. \n",
    "\n",
    "> 👋 For simplicity's sake, each time you will be using this endpoint, new lines will not persist in S3. If you really wanted to do so, you will need to use `.to_csv()` method from `pandas` with AWS credentials to access S3 😉\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data formatting \n",
    "\n",
    "Before the `create_blog_article` function work, we need to define `BlogArticles` class. Here it is: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "class BlogArticles(BaseModel):\n",
    "    title: str\n",
    "    content: str\n",
    "    author: str = \"Anonymous Author\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> 👋 You can paste this code below the `app = FastAPI()` variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Now what does this class do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It defines the incoming data to receive and what format to expect. For example here, `BlogArticles` will contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a `title` which will be of type `str`, with no default value \n",
    "* a `content` which will be of type `str`, with no default value \n",
    "* a `author` which will be of type `str`, with default value of `Anonymous Author` \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, each time you need to access `BlogArticles`, you will specify it within the parameters of your function contained within a **`POST`** request decorator and you can access its values like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "@app.post(\"/another-post-endpoint\")\n",
    "async def another_post_endpoint(blog_article: BlogArticles):\n",
    "    example_data = {\n",

    "    }\n",
    "    return example_data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> 👋 To make this endpoint work, don't forget that your end user (the one using your API) must specify the values of `BlogArticles` with a form for example. You can also use `requests` library and specify a `payload` parameter that will need to contain something like this:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> import requests\n",
    "> payload = {\n",
