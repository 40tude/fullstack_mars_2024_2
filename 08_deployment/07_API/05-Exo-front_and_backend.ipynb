    "## Context üìñ\n",
    "\n",
    "[IBM](ibm.com) is one of the oldest tech companies in the world. Founded in 1911 in New York, they started building computers for the general public. They now serve over 170+ countries in the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a big company like this, one of the challenges is to attract and keep talents that will achieve great goals. Therefore, IBM conducted a research on their employees to study what were the different factors that would drive them to quit. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal üéØ\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, you are working within a team of developers & data scientists. Your management has a project for you: **build an interactive Dashboard** that will help HR know who are their employees and which ones are likely to quit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your team is organized in the following way: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A *Front-End Development Team* in charge of building the visible part of the Dashboard \n",
    "2. A *Back-End Development Team* in charge of getting data from different sources to serve the *Front-End Team*\n",
    "\n",
    "You are part of the *Back-End Development Team*. Therefore **your goal is to build an API** that will manipulate IBM's data. \n",
    "\n",
    "After a quick meeting with the *Front-End Team*, it appears that they need the following endpoints:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `/preview` - To be able to preview a few rows of the dataset\n",
    "    * Front-End should be able to choose how many rows they want to preview \n",
    "    * There should be a default value \n",
    "* `/unique-values` - To be able to get unique values of a given column in the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "* `/groupby` - To be able to group by a given column and chose an aggregation metric \n",
    "    * Front-End should be able to choose which categorical column to use and which aggregation metric (`sum`, `mean`, `max`, `min`...)\n",
    "\n",
    "* `/filter-by` - To be able to filter by one or several, categories within your dataset \n",
    "    * Front-End should be able to choose **one column** and **one or several categories** within that column \n",
    "\n",
    "* `/quantile` - To be able to retrieve the *top x%* or *bottom x%* values of a given column in the dataset \n",
    "    * *i.e* the top 10% `DailyRate` or the lowest 5% `DistanceFromHome`\n",
    "    * Front-End should be able to choose the percentage and to choose whether it's the top or low values\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints üöè\n",
    "\n",
    "Your api must be documented so that your *Front-End Development Team* knows how to use it! A well documented API should at least contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A global description of the app \n",
    "* A description of each endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development Environment \n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget to create your `Dockerfile` to build your development environment. Although, if don't feel comfortable , simply use: `jedha/fast_api_demo_app` image from DockerHub. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data \n",
    "\n",
    "Data can be found here: [IBM HR ATTRITION.xlsx](https://full-stack-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/Deployment/ibm_hr_attrition.xlsx)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
