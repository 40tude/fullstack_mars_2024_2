    "# Build a cancellation detection algorithm ‚ùå\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's practice our newly acquired MLFlow skills by working on a challenge that Jedha's partner [Doctolib](https://www.doctolib.fr/) is facing: **Predicting appointments' cancellations**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Doctolib? üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "Doctolib is the french leading platform for scheduling appointments with local doctors. During the COVID crisis, the company helped the french government organise logistics for Covid vaccines campaign. \n",
    "\n",
    "The company was founded in 2013 and is now part of the [Next40](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next4french) ranking with over 100 000 doctors using their app. \n",
    "\n",
    "<Video video=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xw7rj-Dzk&t=1414s\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge üí™\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenge that Doctolib is facing is **last minute cancellations**. If a person is scheduling a doctor's appointment and actually ends not showing up, it's a waste of time (and money) for the doctor. Too many cancellations can lead to stop using Doctolib app. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore Doctolib would like to *build an algorithm that could predict whether a person is going to cancel his/her appointment* and reduce no-shows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **With the team that you built in the previous exercise, use MLFlow to create the best Machine Learning Algorithm that you can code** \n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the dataset that you will be using for this exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Doctolib Appointments Dataset](https://full-stack-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/Deployment/doctolib_simplified_dataset_01.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an explanation of the columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- PatientId *Identification of a patient*\n",
    "- AppointmentID: *Identification of each appointment*\n",
    "- Gender: *Male or Female*\n",
    "- AppointmentDay: *The day of the actuall appointment, when they have to visit the doctor.*\n",
    "- ScheduledDay: *The day someone called or registered the appointment, this is before appointment of course.*\n",
    "- Age: *How old is the patient.*\n",
    "- Neighbourhood: *Where the appointment takes place.*\n",
    "- Scholarship: *True of False*. This refers to the fact that the person has an insurance or not\n",
    "- Hypertension: *True or False*\n",
    "- Diabetes: *True or False*\n",
    "- Alcoholism: *True or False*\n",
    "- Handcap: *True or False*\n",
    "- SMS_received: *1 or more messages sent to the patient.*\n",
    "- No-show: *True or False.* **üéØ This is your target**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips üôä\n",
    "\n",
    "* Eventhough scripts are better when using MLFLow, you can use `.ipynb` file as well \n",
    "* You can use Machine Learning or Deep Learning algorithms \n",
    "* If you are doing this exercise on your local machine, **we advise you to build your environment in a docker image**\n",
    "    * You can use ours if you don't want to build your own: `jedha/sample-mlflow-server`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Delivrable üíå\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this exercise, your team should present your MLFlow tracking server and showcase your best algorithm. "
