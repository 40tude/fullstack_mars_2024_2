    "# HTTP Protocol & API\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole idea of web development is to make different machines communicate together and send data to each other. Whenever you try and access a webpage with your internet browser your machine uses a certain protocol to communicate with the web server that hosts the webpage. Most of the time this protocol is the HTTP protocol. Moreover, the web is not only populated by websites, but also API, wich are different types of web entities from which you can get data.\n",
    "Let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you'll learn in this course üßêüßê\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will teach you the basics of the HTTP protocol, and how to communicate with websites and APIs using code! We'll come back to talking about APIs in the future when we start creating our own in order to do things such as creating an interface to access models' predictions...\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the outline:\n",

    "* What is the HTTP protocol\n",
    "* How to differenciate a client from a server\n",
    "* What is contained within and HTTP Requests and Response\n",

    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by explaining a term that you will encounter a lot in the future: Backend! Backend in web development is a technical term which refers to everything that's happening behind the scenes on the web and that users looking at their web browser's window do not see. Backend deals with things like handling databases that contain the website's data, servers etc...\n",
    "To fully understand how backend programming works, it is important to understand how communications over the Internet work.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP is the most widely used protocol since the 1990s to transfer data, and instructions over the Internet. Exchanges are made between a **server** and a **web browser** (chrome, firefox, internet explorer etc.) running on a machine known as the **client**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be able to locate data on a server via a URL.\n",

    "What is important to understand is that communication takes place in two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clients performs an **HTTP** **request** via a Browser\n",
    "* Server processes the request and sends an **HTTP** **response**\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of request/response is fundamental because it will determine how you write code. So just imagine your web browser as an interface that allows you to create requests you can send to a server where data is stored, and which will respond according to these requests."
