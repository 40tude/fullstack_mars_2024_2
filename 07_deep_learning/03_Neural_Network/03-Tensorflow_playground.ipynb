    "\n",
    "**In a model with several layers, is it more useful to add more neurons on the layers near the bottom or near the top?**\n",
    "* It is more useful to increase the number of neurons towards the bottom because the complexity of the outputs of earlier neurons limit the complexity of the outputs of later neurons.

    "* In addition to that, these \"features\" are build by neurons which parameters get optimized according to the loss function, so it creates features that are linked to the target variable without having to be explicitely coded!\n",
    "* In a way it is great because feature engineering is difficult and neural networks do it for us, the major downside is that it all happens in what may be qualified as a \"black box\" model. Depending on the data, neural network models may be using features to make predictions that are not at all interpretable or even well aligned with our final goal! \n",

    "**When you use additional features to feed the model, do you need to use as many neurons and layers? Would adding more neurons and layers be an alternative to using additional features?**\n",
    "* Adding new features may let you use less complex architectures, the upside is that you know exactly what input features are used which makes the model more interpretable, on the other hand you may be missing some very useful features that model may have created for you!\n",
