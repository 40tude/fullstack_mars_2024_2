    "    1. Are there years with more releases? Were there more or fewer game releases during the Covid, for example?\n",
    "    1. How are the prizes distributed? Are there many games with a discount?\n",
    "    1. What are the most represented languages?\n",

    "2. Genres analysis\n",
    "    1. What are the most represented genres?\n",
    "    1. Are there any genres that have a better positive/negative review ratio?\n",
    "    1. Do some publishers have favorite genres?\n",
    "    1. What are the most lucrative genres?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Platform analysis\n",
    "    1. Are most games available on Windows/Mac/Linux instead?\n",
    "    1. Do certain genres tend to be preferentially available on certain platforms?\n",
    "    1. You're free to follow these guidelines, or to choose a different angle of analysis, as long as your analysis reveals relevant and useful information."
